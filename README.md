# IMDb Watchlist Manager V1

Automating the rating and deletion of movies from the IMDb watchlist.

## Usage

You should download your own WATCHLIST.csv file from your IMDb account (for now**):
* Login to your account
* Go to Watchlist
* Scroll all the way down and click ```Export this list```
* Put the downloaded file inside the program directory

Next set your email and password to ```PATH```, or you can just enter them inside the ```settings.py``` file.

** In the next versions this would not be needed.
